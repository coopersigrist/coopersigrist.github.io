If you have at least one pair with a different color and at least one pair with a different shape do you necessarily have a pair of vases which have a different color and different shape?</p> <details> <summary>Solution</summary> Yes. Suppose the colors of the vases are $c_1, ..., c_n$ and the shapes are $s_1, ..., s_n$. Also suppose that the first pair of vases, vases 1 and 2, have a different color. Also, the second pair of vases, vases 3 and 4, have a different shape. If vase 1 and vase 3 have a different shape or vase 1 and vase 4 has a different shape, then we already have two vases with a different color and shape, because we know vase 1 and vase 2 have a different color. The other option is vase 1 and vase 3 have the same shape and vase 1 and vase 4 have the same shape, which implies that vase 3 and vase 4 have the same shape, which is a contradiction. </details> </article> </div> </body></html>
